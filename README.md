# Ft_printf
I'm writing ft_printf functions because putnbr and putsr are not enough

## ðŸ’¡ About the project

> _This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments._

	This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version (more
	information below) of the printf function.

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/recepbattal/Ft_printf/blob/main/ft_printf.en.pdf).
